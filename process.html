							<h3>Review of Last Project:</h3>
						</header>
						<p>The group did work well together despite members of the group operating in two distinctly different time zones. Members of the group did get along very well and enjoyed good banter within the group, which at time did cause the group to wander off-topic occasionally. We believe when members of the group did put their heads down and got along with the work, the work being produced was of good quality. We did use assortment of online tools such as Discord and MS Teams to coordinate our efforts.</p>

							<h3>Things to Improve:</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Things to improve as a group, would be looking to get the content done sooner as we seemed to set deadlines but, when it came the work was not quite done yet. Something else would be more communication outside of meetings and planning meetings as quite often we would meet up to talk and not know how we were all going and what we were up to until the meeting was already underway, some instances turning up for the meeting to find out entire sections were done or laid out for us already, Kevin is a GOAT! Also double checking all our "finished" work to make sure that every question has a full and succinct answer or solution to it as we happened to leave out a few in Assignment 2.</p>
