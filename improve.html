												<h2>Improvements and Addons</h2>
												<p>Possible improvements and addons to be included with this project in future</p>
											</header>

											<h3>Possible Improvements</h3>
											<p>One possible upgrade that can be done for future models of the BallAroo is to add a more powerful SBC (Small Board Computer) that is capable of IoT type operations. This could be done through replacing the existing Arduino type unit or provide it as add-on upgrade board. This would allow the unit to connect to cloud-based service to provide value-add features such as:</p>
											<ul class="list">
												<li>Remote control of the unit via the internet using either through an app or a webpage.
												<li>Direct control of the unit via mobile phone app using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
												<li>View status of the unit such as battery level or treats dispenser.
												<li>Recording of usage stats (Pet stats).
												<li>Current location of the unit if fitted with GPS.
												<li>View a video stream from the unit if fitted with camera.
												<li>Communicate with the pet directly if unit is fitted with microphone and speaker.
											</ul>
											<p>Addition of the IoT functionality will increase power consumption as well as cost. Internet connectivity would be provided through a Wi-Fi connection or using the 4G/5G mobile network with an on-board mobile broadband modem. The processing power of the SBC would have to be sufficient to facilitate strong encryption of all internet traffic. These features may not equip the original product, but these features can be provided as add-on options or included in up-market follow-on product.</p>

											<h3>Possible Addons</h3>
											<p>One possible production differentiator would be a companion ball retriever robot. This add-on product could be considered a separate project on its own, as there would be many technical challenges that would have to overcome such as the following:</p>
											<ul class="list">
												<li>Tracking and locating the balls - may require GPS equipped balls.
												<li>Spatial awareness - where the balls are, the ball thrower and what obstacles are in the environment.
												<li>Pathfinding - ability to travel to the balls, retrieve them and return to the ball thrower, all the while avoiding obstacles along the way.
												<li>Some level of object recognition - it must know that it is picking up a ball and not something else.
												<li>Ability to transverse varied and sometimes difficult terrain.
												<li>The Ability to check for any obstructions within the device. 
											</ul>
											<p>These technical challenges are solvable as improvements in processing power and advances in AI technology are constantly improving. But it begs the question, does it negate the whole point of the having the ball thrown for the pet, if it is not for the pet to return the ball themselves. The amount of engineering required to make a general-purpose ball retrieval robot could result in higher retail price for the robot when compared to a fully equipped ball thrower with GPS equipped balls. Considering the intended market are pet owners where the pet would retrieve and return the ball. The robot would have to compete with a pet who is most likely to better at finding and retrieving the ball, a handheld GPS ball locator or just cheap balls where the cost offsets the effort in finding them. Though it would a be interesting engineering project, it may only end up being a gimmick with limited add-on value.</p>
