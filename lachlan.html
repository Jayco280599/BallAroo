										<h2>Lachlan Wild</h2>
										<p>Spark22 Team Member</p>
									</header>
										<p>My name is Lachlan Wild, and my student id is s3893772, my Interest in IT centres around computer programming, primarily because I can create programs which can be used to perform specific tasks for user's needs so that their goals can be achieved in the easiest way for them to complete their task. I am also interested in modern technology, especially new advances in computer hardware and software. My interest in IT really started at the beginning of high school because I was shown how technology has advanced over the years and I wanted to contribute to this evolution. My high school has a 1:1 device policy, so we use IT and computer solutions daily in my studies. One event that sparked my interest in IT was a careers expo that was held at my school. I wandered to the section that was talking about careers in IT and from what I saw I was intrigued by how the virtual world has progressed so much due to augmented and virtual realities. This sparked my interest as I wanted to contribute to developing this type of technology as it has a lot of potential to giving people more entertainment as well as a more interactive workstyle. The experience I have in IT to date is in terms of Programming. I can program in several languages, such as C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, HTML 5. I also have experience with Game Development, using development platforms or game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.</p>
