								<p>I think the group performed quite well together. We all got along with each other remarkably and the 1-1.5 hour plus meetings seemed to breeze past. We had a good balance of work and fun, smashing out a section or two and sharing memes or talking about our gaming stats. It would have been nice to have someone else step up and take charge in times I was busy as it would’ve progressed us further and quicker, but we still managed to get everything completed, checked and looking fantastic as a final document and website. </p>
								<p>Things to improve as a group, would be looking to get the content done sooner as we seemed to set deadlines but, when it came the work was not quite done yet, I also have myself to blame in this regard. Something else would be more communication outside of meetings and planning meetings as quite often we would meet up to talk and not know how we were all going and what we were up to until the meeting was already underway. </p>

								<p>Things that went well was what needed to be done was determined early during the first meetings. The main draft document was created on Office365 online where most the work was done by all the members of the group directly to that document. The collaboration application Discord was used heavily by the group as our main method of text based communication. MS Teams was used as the video conferencing tool for when meetings were held, and each meeting was recorded. Git and GitHub use was rare by the group to any extent. This would be something that would need to be addressed in future if the project were to progress forward, where the creation of source code and CAD files that will need some form of versioning control. Most of the document work was conducted directly on MS Office 365 Online. This allowed the group work on the same documents at separate times and be able see changes have been made. The group did get along well on a personal level and did work together well. One thing I learnt while working with the group, was having to schedule meeting times around each other's commitments and around different time zones. </p>

										<p>Things in my opinion that went well, was the fact that we were all organised enough to get the project started early enough to make plan about how we were going to start to complete the assessment, we also had communicated well by using discord for quick queries and Microsoft Teams as our main meeting place to discuss about how we are going to continue the project. Things that could have been improved is, our usage of the GitHub platform itself as if we were to continue to develop this project, we will need to use this platform to store any vital files and documents. We could have made a time chart to keep organised with the matter of meetings.</p>
										<p>One thing that was surprising was the fact after every meeting after the main agenda was achieved the whole group would become a comedic mess, which is a good sign as we can all have a good time, which should boost productivity as we all can get along with each other. One thing that I’ve learnt about groups that if properly managed they can produce an excellent standard of work that we all agree that were proud of.</p>

										<p>Even though half of the group was in two separate time zones, the group worked effectively together. Members of the group got along swimmingly and had a lot of fun bantering with one another, which caused the group to veer off track from time to time. We feel the work generated by the group was of high quality when members of the group put their heads down and got to work. Throughout the project, we used a variety of online technologies such as Discord and MS Teams to coordinate our activities.</p>
										<p>Things we could do better as a group would be to finish the material sooner, since we appeared to set deadlines, but the job wasn't nearly done when they arrived. Another improvement would be greater contact outside of meetings and planning meetings, as we would often get together to chat and not know how we were all doing or what we were up to until the meeting was already in progress. I was surprised by how different the work was in a group environment, there are more aspects you need to take into account when doing the work such as separating the workload and actually talking to the group before changing or doing something.</p>

							<h3>Combined:</h3>
							<p>Even though each half of the group was in two separate time zones on opposite sides of the country, the group worked did effectively together. The group got along with each other remarkably well and the one hour plus meetings did seem to breeze past. Things that were needed to be done determined and outlined early in the process. Meetings where organised and scheduled using Discord and the meeting themselves were conducted on MS Teams. All the meetings on MS Teams were recorded and members of the group that were not able to be present for the meeting where able to watch the replay of the meetings. All documents and files used by the group were stored using MS SharePoint where all the members of the group were able to contribute to. The use of MS Office 365 Online enabled the group to edit documents for the project in real-time and in collaborative manner. GitHub was only used to host the website for the group project. GitHub usage would be something that would need to address, as the group did not have versioning control of documents and other files in place. The use of GitHub would have provided the needed version control for documents, CAD files and software source code if the project were to proceed any further. Time management would be another aspect of the group that needs to be improved, as members of the group did have conflicting commitments such as other assessments from other courses running concurrently and work commitments.</p>
