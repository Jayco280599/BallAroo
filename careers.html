The experience that will be gained from the development aspects could lead to development in most IT (Information Technology) industries, including web design and video games, and the testing and debugging go hand in hand with helping me along that path too. And the documentation is required in any field where you are trying to convey your thoughts, work, and data. The experience gained from this position can lead Jack to branch into almost any path and industry he could want to extend himself into.</td>
